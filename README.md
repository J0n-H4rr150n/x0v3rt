# Overview of x0v3rt

## What is x0v3rt?

**x0v3rt** is a cross-platform **Security Operations Workbench** built specifically for bug bounty hunters, penetration testers, and security researchers. It combines note-taking, terminal access, AI assistance, and automation into a single, powerful Electron application that runs natively on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Think of it as **Obsidian meets VS Code meets a Security OS** — purpose-built for offensive security workflows.

## 💡 Why x0v3rt?

**The problem:** Security professionals juggle multiple tools — Obsidian for notes, VS Code for scripts, iTerm for terminal, ChatGPT for AI — constantly switching context and losing flow.

**The solution:** x0v3rt unifies these workflows into one purpose-built application, letting you focus on finding vulnerabilities instead of managing tools.

**The vision:** Build the ultimate security researcher's workbench — where notes, AI, automation, and execution live in harmony.
